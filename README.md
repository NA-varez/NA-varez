# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

### In the Present
- [X] Create a github pages website
  - [ ] Add projects to it with short description
  - [ ] Prune old projects
  - [ ] Link in pictures and/or repositories to the projects 
- [ ] Solidify foundation in OOB programming by rewriting an older Java project in C#

### In the Future
- [ ] Transition Markdown Github Pages website to an html website (Maybe just create a google sites website)
- [ ] Learn C/C++ on a deeper level
  - [ ] Demonstrate learning with a repository on github   
- [ ] Learn more about the Unix file system/command-line stuff (course maybe?) Unix commands, shell scripting, file system, editors
