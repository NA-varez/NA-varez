# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I've recently decided to learn more about Github and Markdown! This profile README.md is my first step.

## Here's what I'm up to:

### In the Present
- [X] Create a github pages website
  - [ ] Add all relevant projects to it
  - [ ] Link in pictures and/or repositories to the projects 
- [ ] Solidify foundation in OOB programming by rewriting an older Java project in C#

### In the Future
- [ ] Take an online course on C
  - [ ] Demonstrate learning with a repository on github  
- [ ] Take an online course on C++
  - [ ] Demonstrate learning with a repository on github   
- [ ] Learn more about the Unix file system/command-line stuff (course maybe?) Unix commands, shell scripting, file system, editors
